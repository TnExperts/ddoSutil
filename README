(ddoSutil 1.0)

ddoSutil 1.0 is being completely reworked, the reworked version will be easier to use and
 have significantly more functionality.

11/2011:  ddoSutil 1.0 will be updated soon, with a new firewall builder aimed at ddos attacks.


(ddoSutil v.4)
------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed some typos that were causing issues with particular scripts.

(ddoSutil v.3)
------------------------------------------------------------

ddoSutil is a small collection of Linux scripts designed to deal with minor to moderate ddos attacks.  
Modern DDOS attacks have the ability to attack various resources, therefore ddoSutil comes with a 
combination of scripts intended to deal with different attack methods.  

Please send all feedback, suggestions, bugs to russ @ vigeek .net

(License)
------------------------------------------------------------
GPL v3

(Tested Compatibility)
------------------------------------------------------------
Red Hat Based:  CentOS, RHEL, Fedora
Debian Based:   Ubuntu, Debian  
Other:  Should work with most *nix distros.

(Installation)
------------------------------------------------------------
Download the install.sh script (net installation, downloads files automatically).
wget vigeek.net/projects/ddoSutil/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

(Usage)
------------------------------------------------------------
Nearly all of the ddoSutil scripts have a usage page (and the one or two that don't will) 
Simply executing the script with -h will show the usage parameters.
ie. ./ddoSutil-harden.sh -h

Will create a legit usage document soon...

(Modules)
------------------------------------------------------------
1)  ddoSutil-geoIP.sh [bash]
	. The GeoIP scripts blocks connectivity from a particular country.
	. Easy to use, can unlock/block country with single command.
	. GeoIP database is automatically updated.
	. Fast operation, takes less than one minute to block an entire country.
	. Works out of the box (uses IPTables chains)
	. Most DDOS attacks originate from another country, therefore blocking can be effective.

2)  ddoSutil-harden.sh [bash]
	. The harden script implements several basic preventative measures.
	. Implements:  SYN Filtering, Forwarding(off), ICMP filtering and spoof protection.
	. Configures IPTables to set a hard quota on the amount of connections per IP address (global).
	. Options can easily be independently enabled or disabled.

3)  ddoSutil-gpblock.sh [bash]
	. Often DDOS attacks will make get/post requests to invalid resources i.e site.com/a?38383.
	. The gpblock.sh module scans Apache style log files for these requests,
	. When a request that matches is found, we add the offending IP adress to a blocked list.
	. Configurable, define the number of requests to a resource per IP before blocking.
	. Easy to use, ability to edit/remove block lists or add to existing.
	. Works out of the box (uses IPTables chains)

4) ddoSutil-refblock.sh [bash]
	. DDOS attacks can come from a select few referrers.
	. refblock allows you to define who these referrers are.
	. refblock finds all the IP associated with a particular refferer and blocks connectivity.

5) ddoSutil-mySQLrecover.pl [perl] 
	. DDOS attacks that seep through to the database layer often overload mySQL server.
	. mySQLrecover.pl is effective at killing slow/hung queries bogging down a mySQL server.
	. Configurable ability to set threshold (in seconds) to define which queries to kill.

6) ddoSutil-deflate.py [python] - Integrated DDOS deflate support.
	. Implements DDOS deflate into Python.
	. Improved performance and usability.
	. Integrates with existing ddoSutil scripts.
7) ddoSutil-nstat.sh [bash]
        . Shows detailed network information.
        . Useful at determining the type of ddos attack.
