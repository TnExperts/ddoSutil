		dSutil 0.3 by Russ@viGeek.net
-------------------------------------------------------------

dSutil is a small series of bash scripts I wrote in order to deal with 
minor-moderate ddos attacks.  This is really only suitable if your 
infrastructure can handle the attack but server cant handle the load, 
which is often the case if you're hosting in a datacenter.

I originally wrote this for a company several years ago, however in it's 
present state it's outdated and has never been user friendly.  I'm going 
to do a clean rewrite and release components individually, then tie it 
all together at the end.  But each component may be used on it's own.
